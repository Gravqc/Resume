        <p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going
            at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will
            be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity 
            to complete one of three common writing challenges.</p>
